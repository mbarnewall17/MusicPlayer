Music player application for the Android Platform. This application is for playing local music on one's device. The Android MediaStore provides access to database full of all music on the device. This application uses that database and creates a library of music for the user, from which they can choose what to play.

This application is a work in progress. App functions well but as of now, it still lacks many features found in other applications.
